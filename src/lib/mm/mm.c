// Memory manager which support up to 64bits CPUs.
// The current limitation for 64bits can be lifted
// by increasing the value of MMSMALLESTBUDDYCLOG2.
// 
// -------------------------------------------------------
// Through a syscall, the kernel make memory
// available to a thread in pagesize of 4096 bytes.
// A memory manager wouldn't be needed if memory
// requests made by a thread were amounts that were
// all multiples of a pagesize; but in reality
// a thread will need smaller amounts or amounts
// that are not multiples of a pagesize.
// ei: If only 14 bytes is needed, it would be
// a waist to allocate 4096 bytes everytime that
// a small amount of memory is needed. Hence the need
// for a memory manager which will allow a thread to
// judiciously and efficiently partition memory pages
// that it receives from the kernel.
// ei: Two allocations of 14 bytes each will be
// allocated from the same 4096 bytes that
// was requested from the kernel.
// 
// To perform its task, the memory manager will use
// the buddy system algorithm to partition the memory
// pages that it receives from the kernel when possible.
// In fact the buddy system algorithm will partition
// the memory pages that it receive from the kernel
// in blocks having sizes that are powers of two.
// If using the buddy system algorithm will result in
// a waist of memory, the memory manager do not use
// the buddy system algorithm, but instead find the best
// multiple of a pagesize that satisfy the memory request.
// 
// 
// ==== Description of the buddy system algorithm ====
// 
// Allocation is done in blocks of sizes that are powers
// of two; in a 32bits system, the minimum block size
// being 2^6 and maximum block size being 2^31;
// a linkedlist of free blocks for each block size
// is maintained, in other words, there is a linkedlist
// of free blocks for each block size: 2^6, 2^7, 2^8,
// 2^9, 2^10,...,2^31; hence a total of 26 linkedlists.
// 
// Block size are chosen as powers of two so that they can
// easily be splitted in two. ei: a block of size 2^10 can
// be splitted into two blocks of size 2^9; the two blocks
// resulting from the split are called buddies.
// By the same token they are chosen as power of two so
// that buddies can easily be merged together to form
// a single block. ei: Two buddies of size 2^11 are merged
// into a single block of size 2^12.
// 
// When a memory allocation of a particular size
// is requested, the size is rounded up to a valid
// block size which is a power of two. The power of
// two size is then used to obtain the desired block
// from the appropriate linkedlist of free blocks.
// ei: Requesting 10kb of memory will get a block from
// the linkedlist of free blocks of size 16kb or 2^14;
// if the linkedlist for that block size is empty,
// a block from a larger block size is splitted down to
// the needed block size.
// 
// When a memory block is freed, to prevent fragmentation,
// buddies are merged together if both of them are not
// being used. The result of the merge is added to the
// appropriate linkedlist of free blocks.
// 
// The main advantage of the buddy memory allocation system
// is that allocation is very fast and merging of blocks,
// to prevent fragmentation, is cheap because the buddy
// of any block can be calculated from its address.
